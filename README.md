# TreeMapProject
This project creates two concrete data structures implementing a common Map interface, IMap. 
The UnbalancedMap class is built directly from scratch.
The BalancedMap class uses the TreeMap package. 
This project practices a classical data structure – the binary search tree – while simultaneously
exploring Java generics and the Comparable design pattern.
